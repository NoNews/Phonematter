## Dependency

    repositories {
        maven { url "https://dl.bintray.com/terrakok/terramaven" }
    }
    
    dependencies {
        compile "com.terrakok.phonematter:phonematter:1.0@aar"
    }


## Usage

In its simplest form you do the following:
    
    PhoneFormat phoneFormat = new PhoneFormat(getContext());
    // Call any number of times
    String numberString = "..."; //the phone number to format
    String formattedString = phoneFormat.format(numberString);

You can also pass in a specific default country code if you don't want to rely on the Region Format setting. Pass in a valid ISO 3166-1 two-letter country code in lowercase:

    PhoneFormat phoneFormat = new PhoneFormat("uk", getContext());
    // Call any number of times
    String numberString = "..."; //the phone number to format
    String formattedString = phoneFormat.format(numberString);

You may also use the singleton interface if desired:

    PhoneFormat phoneFormat = PhoneFormat.getInstance(getContext());
    // Call any number of times
    String numberString = "..."; //the phone number to format
    String formattedString = phoneFormat.format(numberString);

To validate a phone number you can do the following:

    PhoneFormat phoneFormat = new PhoneFormat(getContext());
    // Call any number of times
    String numberString = "..."; //the phone number to validate
    boolean valid = phoneFormat.isPhoneNumberValid(numberString);
    
The phone number to validate can include formatting characters or not. The number will be valid if there are an appropriate set of digits.

PhoneFormat can also be used to lookup a country's calling code:

    PhoneFormat phoneFormat = PhoneFormat.getInstance(getContext());
    String callingCode = phoneFormat.callingCodeForCountryCode("AU"); // Australia - returns 61
    String defaultCallingCode = phoneFormat.defaultCallingCode(); // based on current Region Format (locale)
